/**
 * The one command a fresh clone runs, and the one you re-run after merging a PR
 * in a submodule.
 *
 * `git clone --recurse-submodules` already brings the repos, and because git
 * stores symlinks verbatim `.claude/skills/` arrives working — nothing stands
 * between a clone and an agent seeing the skills. What is missing is a branch to
 * work on and the `node_modules` trees.
 *
 * The branch half is `sync`, called rather than reimplemented: `git submodule
 * update` checks out the *recorded commit*, and a commit is not a branch, so it
 * leaves every submodule on a detached HEAD where the next commit you write goes
 * somewhere no branch can see. `sync` puts each one on its declared branch and
 * fast-forwards it, and it is careful about the two cases where that would be
 * rude — a dirty tree, or a submodule you have checked out onto a feature
 * branch. Its header has the rest.
 *
 * `npm ci` is skipped where `node_modules` already exists, which is what makes
 * this safe to re-run rather than only useful once: `npm ci` deletes the tree
 * before rebuilding it, and slack-gatekeeper's is not a small one. `--force`
 * when you do want the clean rebuild.
