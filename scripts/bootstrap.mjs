/**
 * The one command a fresh clone runs, and the one you re-run after merging a PR
 * in a submodule.
 *
 * `git clone --recurse-submodules` already brings the repos, and because git
 * stores symlinks verbatim `.claude/skills/` arrives working — unless the clone
 * decided this filesystem has no symlinks, in which case every link arrives as a
 * plain file naming its own target, `CLAUDE.md` included, and nothing says so.
 * Repairing that is `symlinks.mjs`, whose header has the why. What is missing
 * besides is a branch to work on and the `node_modules` trees.
 *
 * The branch half is `sync`, called rather than reimplemented: `git submodule
 * update` checks out the *recorded commit*, and a commit is not a branch, so it
 * leaves every submodule on a detached HEAD where the next commit you write goes
 * somewhere no branch can see. `sync` puts each one on its declared branch and
 * fast-forwards it, and it is careful about the two cases where that would be
 * rude — a dirty tree, or a submodule you have checked out onto a feature
 * branch. Its header has the rest.
 *
 * A url in `.gitmodules` does not reach a checkout that already exists. `git
 * submodule init` copied the old one into `.git/config` and into each submodule's
 * `origin`, and only `git submodule sync` moves it — so that runs first, every
 * time, and a url change self-heals for anyone who runs the one command a clone is
 * told to run. It rewrites remotes and nothing else.
 *
 * It also overwrites a remote someone re-pointed by hand, which is the reason to
 * express a transport preference as a `url.<base>.insteadOf` rewrite instead: git
 * applies that on top of whatever the remote says, so the two never fight.
 * AGENTS.md has the line.
 *
 * `npm ci` is skipped where `node_modules` already exists, which is what makes
 * this safe to re-run rather than only useful once: `npm ci` deletes the tree
 * before rebuilding it, and slack-gatekeeper's is not a small one. `--force`
 * when you do want the clean rebuild.
