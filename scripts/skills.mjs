/**
 * `.agents/skills/` is where skills live. `.claude/skills/` is where Claude Code
 * looks. This script is the bridge, and the reason it exists rather than being a
 * one-time `ln -s` is that the bridge decays on its own.
 *
 * `npx skills add` writes into `.agents/skills/` and knows nothing about
 * `.claude/skills/`. So every install, update or removal leaves the two out of
 * step, and the failure is silent in the direction that matters: Claude Code does
 * not announce a skill it never found. A skill that stopped loading looks exactly
 * like a skill that was never useful.
 *
 * Hence a check in `npm run check`, and a writer that is safe to re-run.
 *
 * ## The invariant
 *
 * This script owns `.claude/skills/` outright. Every entry there is a symlink
 * whose target is exactly `../../.agents/skills/<name>` for a `<name>` that
 * exists, and nothing else may live in that directory.
 *
 * **The target is relative, and that is the whole portability guarantee.** An
 * absolute link works on the machine that made it and breaks in every clone —
 * including the cloud sessions this workspace exists to serve. Git stores the
 * link text verbatim, so an absolute path is not a local mistake; it is committed
 * and published. That is why a link resolving to the right directory is still a
 * failure here if it spells the path absolutely.
 *
 * ## What it checks, and why each one is real
 *
 *   - **A source with no link.** `npx skills add`. The common case.
 *   - **A link that no longer resolves.** `npx skills remove`.
 *   - **A link with the wrong target**, including an absolute one — see above.
 *   - **A real directory where a link belongs.** Someone copied a skill in
 *     instead of linking it. It works today and silently stops tracking
 *     `.agents/` forever after, which is worse than not working at all.
 *   - **A link that resolves to no `SKILL.md`.** A half-finished install. Claude
 *     Code skips such a directory without saying so, so nothing else would ever
 *     report it.
 *   - **A `skills-lock.json` entry with no directory.** The lockfile is the
 *     record of what `npx skills` believes is installed; an entry with nothing
 *     behind it means an install did not finish.
 *
 * That last check runs in **one direction only**: every locked entry needs a
 * directory, but a directory needs no lock entry. Today nothing is hand-authored
 * and the two sets coincide, so the asymmetry buys nothing yet — it is here so
 * that authoring a skill by hand later is not a build failure that has to be
 * debugged before it can be understood. Absence from the lockfile is also the
 * only thing distinguishing a hand-authored skill from a vendored one, which is
 * what makes it worth stating rather than tightening.
 *
 * ## What the writer will not do
 *
 * It creates, repairs and prunes symlinks. It will **not** delete a real
 * directory found in `.claude/skills/`, even though the invariant forbids one:
 * a symlink holds no data and a directory might be the only copy of something.
 * That case is reported in both modes and fixed by hand.
