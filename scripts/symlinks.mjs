/**
 * Put the symlinks back when a clone flattened them.
 *
 * `CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md`, and every entry in `.claude/skills/`, is a symlink,
 * and git stores one verbatim: mode 120000, and a blob whose entire content is
 * the target path. That is the portability guarantee `skills.mjs` describes — the
 * link text is committed, so a clone is supposed to bring working links.
 *
 * Except when it does not. git probes for symlink support the first time it
 * writes a working tree, and a probe that fails — Windows without developer mode,
 * some container and network filesystems, a mount that was read-only for the
 * second git looked — writes `core.symlinks=false` into that repo's **local**
 * config. From then on git checks a symlink out as a plain file containing the
 * target path as text, and considers that correct: `git status` stays clean,
 * because under `core.symlinks=false` the text file *is* how a symlink is spelled
 * here. Nothing complains, and the probe's verdict outlives whatever made it
 * fail — the config is written once and re-read forever.
 *
 * What that costs:
 *
 *   - **`CLAUDE.md` stops being instructions.** It becomes a nine-byte file
 *     reading `AGENTS.md`. An agent loads it, finds a filename where the
 *     conventions should have been, and proceeds without them. Nothing reports
 *     this, because from git's side nothing is wrong.
 *   - **`npm run check` fails**, in the one way `skills.mjs` will not fix on its
 *     own: every skill link reported as "a real file, not a link", each with
 *     instructions to sort it out by hand.
 *
 * So `bootstrap` and `sync` both run this, and it does two things per repo — the
 * superproject and every submodule with a checkout, because each has its own
 * config and so its own copy of the problem:
 *
 *   1. Overrule the stale probe with `core.symlinks=true`, after checking that
 *      this filesystem really can make a symlink. The whole failure is a probe
 *      that was wrong, so this cannot take git's word for it — and must not take
 *      its own word either: forcing the config where symlinks genuinely do not
 *      work trades a quiet mess for a checkout that fails outright.
 *   2. Re-materialize what the old setting already flattened, which step 1 does
 *      not do on its own. The config governs the *next* checkout, and for a file
 *      already on disk and considered clean there is never a next one.
 *
 * Step 2 restores **only** a regular file whose bytes are exactly the target
 * path — the thing git itself wrote. Anything else living at that path, however
 * similar it looks, is somebody's data: it is reported and left where it is. A
 * `git checkout --` is not undoable and a symlink is one line, and the asymmetry
 * says which way to err.
 *
 * On a healthy checkout this reads the index, finds every link already a link,
 * and says nothing.
