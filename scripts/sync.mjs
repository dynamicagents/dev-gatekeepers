/**
 * Bring every submodule to the tip of its declared branch — the command you run
 * after merging a PR in one of them.
 *
 * This is not `git submodule update --remote --merge`, which has a flaw that
 * bites exactly here: on a detached HEAD it merges the remote branch *into the
 * detached HEAD*, leaving you still detached, now at a commit with no name.
 * And `git submodule update` in any form checks out the *recorded* commit — a
 * commit is not a branch, so it detaches you, and the next commit you write goes
 * somewhere no branch can see. You find that out after writing it.
 *
 * So: check out the declared branch, then fast-forward it from the remote.
 *
 * ## What it refuses to touch
 *
 *   - **A submodule with uncommitted changes.** Moving a branch under a dirty
 *     tree is how you lose work you have not named yet.
 *   - **A submodule on some other branch.** You are mid-feature there. Checking
 *     out `main` under you loses no commits but loses your place, which a
 *     command you run for its side effect on *other* repos has no business
 *     doing.
 *
 * `--ff-only` is the rest of the safety: a branch carrying local commits, or one
 * rewritten upstream, stops with its own message rather than being merged into
 * silently.
 *
 * ## Why it does not bump the pointers
 *
 * Moving a submodule and recording where it moved to are separate decisions. The
 * pin is the combination that was green together, so it advances when you have
 * decided it should, in a commit that says so. This prints what moved and leaves
 * that to you.
