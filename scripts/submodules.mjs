/**
 * The four repos are submodules, and a submodule has two independent states: the
 * pointer this repo records, and whatever is checked out in the directory. They
 * are *supposed* to differ.
 *
 * That is what this script is careful not to check. A pointer is a known-good
 * combination — the commits that were green together — not a mirror of the four
 * `main` branches. Every commit in a subrepo makes it stale by design, and
 * `npm run sync` is how you move it when you want to. A check that failed on
 * staleness would fail constantly and be disabled within a week, and it would be
 * enforcing something nobody decided.
 *
 * So this checks **structure, not currency**: whether the submodules would
 * survive a clone.
 *
 *   - Every `.gitmodules` entry has a `url` and a `branch`. The branch is not
 *     decoration: `git submodule update --remote` reads it, and without it
 *     `npm run sync` silently does nothing for that repo.
 *   - Every declared path exists and is initialized. An uninitialized submodule
 *     is an empty directory, and every tool downstream treats it as a repo with
 *     no files rather than as an error.
 *   - Every recorded pointer names a commit that exists in that submodule.
 *
 * `--pushed` is the other half and is deliberately **not** in `check`, which has
 * no network. A pointer to a commit that exists only on this machine passes every
 * local check and fails `git clone --recurse-submodules` for everyone else — the
 * one failure that breaks the thing this workspace is for, and the one that
 * cannot be seen from here without asking the remote.
